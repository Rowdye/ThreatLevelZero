# Threat Level Zero
 
Main inspiration from Lethal Company and Left 4 Dead, with hints of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Nuclear Nightmare, Project Zomboid

# Outline
Players are a group of four survivors tasked to clear objectives in a zombie apocalyptic world. They must enter an area and complete the objective without dying in order to reduce the overall threat level. The higher the threat level, the more difficult it is to defend your home base every few nights.

After abandoning all efforts to take control of the zone, the military nuked the area containing the outbreak and secured a perimeter, letting no one in or out. Those who survived both the outbreak and the blast now must navigate through various environments to get scrap, resources, defences, and weapons in order to improve their chances of survival, having to cut and shoot through zombies while keeping special radiated zombies and mystical creatures off of their backs.

# Game Content Ideas
At home base, players choose what objective to go to. Some objectives are further away than others, which costs more fuel but tend to reduce threat level further. Some objective ideas:
• Eliminate horde / nest, plant a bomb in a zombie horde or hot spot
• Fix radio tower, repair cables and radio box, then restart generator
• Rescue mission, find injured survivors and bring them to safety
• Build barricades, block off multiple entrances with barricades
• Charge batteries, carry and insert four large battery banks to the charger and defend
• Take power reactor, find the generator room and take the reactor out and return it to the car
• Time survival, enter the area and survive, the longer you live, the more threat is removed
• Kill target, find and kill the Tank
• Loot overrun survivor base, creates high threat in return for good loot
• More when I think of them.

Objectives are also sometimes accompanied by secondary objectives, which are just normal objectives but the requirements are lower and easier. The benefits of doing these are undecided (maybe revive dead players?) 

There is a chance of weather in the area upon arrival, or weather developing / clearing mid round. With base upgrades you can scout weather on objectives. Some weathers are:
• Clear, most common weather, standard way of playing
• Windy, outside enemies have reduced hearing but scent travels further in the wind direction
• Radiation smog, slightly reduced vis, being outside for too long will build up radiation and begin to hurt you. Worse if you have a broken gas mask. Certain monsters are empowered by it
• Storm, can be dry or wet, lightning randomly strikes outside and on metallic objects. Higher the elevation, the higher the chance
• Electrical interference, electronics will malfunction randomly such as static-y radios, flashlights are faint, batteries drain rapidly, etc.
• Unusual darkness, no matter the time of day it will be dark, allowing certain monsters to spawn early
• Fog, severely reduced visibility, can be paired with radiation smog for much more dangerous build up
• Definitely more can be added to the list.

On top of these two factors, there is also a random modifier. They are typically revealed, but a chance to be unknown. Can be always shown with an upgrade:
• None, most common and standard game-play
• High density, enemies are more prominent in the area
• Low density, as above but reversed
• High alert, enemies' senses are more aware
• Poor air quality, you move slower and stamina is reduced outside
• Clear air quality, you move faster and stamina is increased outside
• Desperate, enemies deal more damage but have less health
• Light loot, loot value is generally worse but weighs less
• Heavy loot, loot value is generally better but weighs more
• Big ones, only tough enemies
• Small ones, only weak enemies
• Special ones, all except normal zombies spawn. Much less enemies than usual
• Normal ones, only normal zombies spawn, more enemies than usual
• Trap galore, greatly increased amount of traps indoors and outdoors, less enemies
• Time limit, at a random time between 6pm and midnight, the radiation will rapidly ramp up, eventually resulting in inevitable death if you stay for too long
• Probably enough, can't think of anything else.

Upon selecting an objective, players arrive by car. The car can be upgraded with parts found at objectives to increase storage, improve fuel economy, muffler to reduce threat gained, etc. The car key will be given to a random survivor. They can drop it to give to someone else but if the key is lost, the car will have to be hot-wired which takes time, makes noise, and costs extra fuel. Survivors attempt to do the objective while enemies wander around the map. List of some enemy ideas:
• Zombie, drags itself around till it senses a survivor, then shambles towards them. Once within close proximity, it will speed up and lunge at the player to do damage
• Big Zombie, same as Zombie but slower and tougher. Swings to attack you most of the time, but can charge occasionally. Will always grab if it’s charge hits you
• Spitter Zombie, gives off radiation in a small area, can spit a medium sized puddle of radioactive sludge at a distance every so often, and leaves a small puddle on death (L4D2 Spitter)
• Tank, very big, high health pool, and muscular zombie that runs at survivors. Considered a boss zombie, and is very rare. Can only fit in large spaces, and is usually only outside. Swings and punches will fling survivors. Can throw rocks at survivors that are too far or unreachable (L4D2 Tank)
• Long Zombie, takes mass from its own body to give to its arm to extend it towards survivors and grabs them from long distances. (L4D2 Smoker) Less health when grabbing, but strong when not. Prioritises those away from the group
• Dog Zombie, very agile and fast enemy that hunts down weak survivors. Jumps and pins survivors (L4D2 Hunter)
• "Ethereal Walker", a mystical creature that lurks in the dark, getting behind survivors to instantly kill them. It is deadly silent and only scatters away when in light or shined at. Appears mostly at night but anytime in dark areas (LC Bracken / Flowerman)
• Survivor, 50/50 chance of being hostile or friendly. On sight of a player, if hostile it will shoot survivors on sight, and when friendly they will run away
• Thief, a radiated and mutated survivor that targets the player with the most valuables, jumps on them and steals a random item, then runs away
• "Swarmer", a mutated animal that sends out small bugs from its body to crawl over players, forcing them to kill the host or use AoE weapons. Bugs will slow down survivors and affect their aim, but otherwise does very little damage to full health survivors, however will do more damage depending on how low the affected survivor’s health is.
• "Decoy Beast", a cunning creature which mimics human voices and player-related sounds to lure survivors closer to them, then attack them. Can disguise as a random survivor. Only appears when a survivor has died (LC Masked)
• Infector, the only enemy capable of passing the infection. A big blob that crawls around slowly, spewing out spores in an area. Having an open wound or broken gas mask will likely get you infected.
• All my ideas for now. I want less zombie ideas and more mutated animals or creatures

# Gameplay
Survivors collect scrap at objectives, which is 'money', but can also find buildings, weapons, and parts which can be taken back to home base to be used for defence or improvements. The car only holds so much without upgrades or extensions so careful choices will have to be made. A Survivor is also affected by weight, so too many heavy items can slow you down, increase stamina drain, and drastically increase fall damage. Survivors can drop their bag after a brief delay, useful in scenarios where they need to escape quickly, but leave a lot of their ammo in their bags and have reduced inventory slots.

Enemies that grab you will prevent you from moving or fighting back, while slowly damaging you and at the mercy of your teammates to help. Survivors don't always instantly die, instead they are usually 'downed' and will require another teammate to revive them before they bleed out. Enemies can hurt you while downed, speeding up the process. When dead, you will have to wait until your teammates suffer the same fate or leave. I might add defibrillators or some way for players to get back in the game, but it will be expensive, and certain causes of death are unrevivable.

Infection is a mechanic that is possible from the Infector (and maybe other things too, at some point), survivors will not know until minutes later when they get sick. Taking pills will delay the infection but not clear it, only vaccines will but they are very rare. When a player is close to turning, undead enemies will be uninterested in them which can allow for some unique plays, but at the cost of severe debuffs. There is also a rare chance that you are naturally immune to the infection, if you're not then you’ll always have the awesome choice of turning the gun on yourself.

If everyone dies, the threat level will increase drastically and all items taken into that mission will be lost. Survivors will have to be careful to make sure they have left over supplies at base in case they fail a mission. At a trader, they can spend a very large sum of scrap to retrieve their items back. If they don’t complete the objective and leave, threat level is increased moderately and a base attack is very likely.

When survivors decide to leave during or after an objective, they must turn on the car and ideally wait for all survivors to enter the vehicle. After that, they can choose to go to another objective right away (though items will stay, not be dropped off at base) at a significantly reduced fuel cost and much less threat gained. Or go home, which will allow survivors to rest, unload items, buy perks items, or build improvements for the base.

Every couple of days, the base may be attacked depending on threat level. The higher the threat level, the higher the chance of attack and the more enemies there are at once. However, no matter the threat level, the more days passed will mean more total enemies. When attacked, enemies will break barricades, props, windows, and doors to get to players. Survivors can set up defences like spikes, turrets, electrical fences, barbed wire, etc. to prevent or slow down the attacks. Survivors should stock pile ammo in preparation for these attacks or they risk running out and are at the mercy of their defences. The base is considered overrun if enemies are inside for too long, or if all players die. If they are overrun, the game is over. If the attack is fought off, survivors resume with whatever is left.

Those that die during an objective or a base attack will be revived after the objective or base attack is done, and will suffer some debuffs.

Perhaps something to implement later down the line, but players will be able to unlock cosmetics when reaching a milestone in particular statistics, such as zombies killed, objectives completed, longest days survived, teammates saved / healed, etc. Depending on the tracked statistic, they will get different types of clothing, so zombies killed might award more stylish clothing, whereas longest days survived will have more protective clothing.

# Art-style
I believe that an art-style similar to Half Life 1 / Counter-Strike 1.6 will be a good art-style for the game. The old graphics induce a weird feeling to players that make it feel nostalgic and safe, but also creepy. It will significantly reduce the workload needed, but also give a unique look while allowing more PC performance to focus on AI and gameplay instead of complicated graphics. Due to the unrealistic nature of the game, having such a 'cartoon' and flat coloured style will promote a more casual play-through and allows for a broad audience to be attracted to the game. In addition to the old graphics, it will have real time shadows and lighting which will give it a modern look (like Abiotic Factor), as well as other modern effects.

Sounds will be a little clearer and more realistic than what HL1 and CS1.6 had. Sounds behind walls will be muffled, and sounds far away will echo. Voice chat will be a very big part of the experience and many systems will utilise it. Enemies will listen and be attracted to voice chat, and if players want to talk extra quietly they will have to crouch. Radios are extra loud without upgrades, so poor planning, positioning, and communication can result in unneeded attention. I am currently unsure on voice acting for survivors. Players should use their own mics and voice for their own characters to create a sense of "This is me in this world" rather than "I’m playing a character in this world".

# Theme
The game will be low saturated, meaning there are only bleak, boring colours. Generally greens, greys, and browns. Most maps will have no life and dead trees, concrete architecture, rubble piles everywhere, and destroyed buildings. The sky is typically cloudy, fog looms in the distance meaning you can’t see very far from the playable area. I like the style of Pripyat, which is an area in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster zone. The architecture of the buildings in that zone are are very ‘brutalist’, featuring raw concrete, geometric shapes, prioritise function over decoration, and are monolithic in appearance by being big and tall. It also looks very dystopian and liminal, which only makes the environment and ambience creepier. I think this will be a suitable design that works with the art-style, and not all maps have to follow it. I don’t want it to be exactly brutalist but just generally inspired.

The in-game universe will be set in the future, or an alternate timeline where tech is slightly more advanced. I’m not sure exactly what will be different, its just what I would prefer to allow logical explanations for certain items or creatures to exist. Gives me more room to add weird stuff.

# Misc section
A bunch of paragraphs that I don’t think deserve a whole section

As a player gets more experienced, they will unlock more starting options that will help their games, such as entering the first objective with a better weapon, choosing multiple skills, starting with more scrap, etc. These benefits will never be good enough to solely ‘carry’ a team far into the game, but just to help initially. Difficulty will slowly scale up the longer the survivors last, meaning that eventually it will be very hard. I’m not sure if I should have an ending for the game, or if there were to be then it would be difficult and takes a long time to achieve. Maybe building a plane to fly out of the zone?

## Replay-ability
I do think that levels should be somewhat procedurally generated, but not completely. Sometimes a door might be blocked off, or now there is a hole in the floor. Props are moved around in some rooms, lights are turned off or are all on, etc. In addition to all of that, there will be random weather, objectives, and modifiers which should be enough to keep games interesting for a very long time. A game such as Deep Rock Galactic already does something similar to this, and is still a very popular game.

## Visual and audio design
Each enemy will have a distinct audio cue for when they attack, allowing players to response appropriately even if they are not looking or aware of the enemy. Like L4D2’s carefully designed Special Infected, each one had their own ‘audio range’ and ‘sonic’ so that players could very easily tell between the 8 infected during action, while also fitting the infected’s design. Visual design will also be similar to the character design principles Valve followed, which was testing a character’s identifability by painting them to be black silhouettes and getting playtesters to identify them.

## Game economy
Survivors will have to manage scrap, fuel, ammo, food, and water to survive. Food and water will not be necessary to live, and only serve to buff player stats. Scrap is essentially money, and is used to trade, upgrade items, or used in home base improvements. Fuel is needed to travel to objectives, without enough fuel then the survivors will arrive by foot (meaning less storage space), and have less health than usual, though less threat is generated. Maybe you can bring wheelbarrows to make going on foot more viable?

## Issues with Lethal Company
Lethal Company has its fair share of issues that I don’t want to replicate. Here are some that I can think off the top of my head:
• Too many insta-kill enemies and traps. It is not fun when you die early and now you have to wait for your team to die or leave.
• Time is too short. In LC, you have roughly 13 minutes to loot, even then most people leave around 3pm (5 - 7 minutes) since you risk dying after 4pm due to all the enemies spawning inside and outside. 
• It is impossible to get far in LC. The quota days never extends from 3 days, meaning that at some point you can’t make enough money to beat the quota. No ending either. The progression is short and you can get most of the good items after a few quotas
• Every time you die, you start from nothing, which is very demotivating and boring.
• Too much “trial and error”, most of the time you figure out how an enemy works after you die. New players suffer when playing with experienced players, sometimes getting left behind since there isn’t enough time in a day to explain enemies or mechanics. 
• Too repetitive. Just get in, get scrap, drop it off at a ship, and repeat it all while surviving. No variation except for weather and if certain monsters will spawn. 
• Too much RNG, scrap can just sometimes not spawn
• Not enough new content. Despite the developer being rich as fuck, he refuses to update the game, leaving it to modders to make new content. He has also stated in the past that he thinks LC is mostly done, and doesn’t want to hire developers to help him with the game.

# Final words
I do think that this is a doable project, but it is a lot to do. It is likely that half of the stuff in here won’t be achieved in it’s first version, and will take a very long time to develop it completely. It will need multiple people for it to be developed at decent quality and refinement, but I have tried to keep it somewhat simple (no open world, no fully randomly generated levels, a lack of cut-scenes or story, etc.) Even if it turns out that a lot of the idea doesn’t work or can’t be done due to skill level, a lot can be salvaged into another idea. I want to get a very very barebones prototype of the game running just so there is something to show to people and get some interest on it. We’ll have to see!
